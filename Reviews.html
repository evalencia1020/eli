      <p> “The Notebook” was released on June 25th, 2004. It was directed by Nick Cassavetes, based on the 1996 novel written by American novelist Nicholas Sparks. This film takes place in the 1940’s in South Carolina telling the romantic but tragic love story between rich Allie Hamilton and poor Noah Calhoun. Allie who is played by Rachel McAdams and Noah played by Ryan Gosling are in a challenging teenage relationship. The movie starts off with a beautiful sunset and a quote read by narrator James Garner. Shifting to an older sick Allie that suffers from Alzheimer’s and is living in a nursing home. An older guy visits Allie and reads to her a love story of two young teenagers in love. Starting from the beginning of the love story the movie continues by showing how Noah and Allie met. Noah is instantly attracted to Allie and does not stop chasing after her until she agrees to go on a date. After their first set up date they form a bond becoming inseparable spending every waking moment together.

      <p> As Allie and Noah’s relationship continues to grow Allie’s parents don’t seem to approve of the relationship. Leading to a tragic separation with two heartbroken teens who end up living different lives. Allie goes on to nursing school and helps to nurse soldiers back to health, while Noah joins the battle in World War II. This leaves a mysterious future to Allie and Noah’s love story. When Allie is about to get married to soon to be husband Lon Hammond, she discovers that Noah built their dream house and is drawn to go visit him. This visit leads to a hot rekindle in their long lost romance and Allie finds herself stuck between two suitors.

      <p> This story is an amazing film and has been very successful. Did you know that? Gosling was Cassavetes first and only choice for the character of Noah. McAdamas received the script the night before the audition and ended up getting the role over actress Jessica Biel and so many others. Cassavetes also chose his mother Gena Rowlands to play older Allie. One thing most people do not know about the filming process was that Gosling and co-star McAdams apparently did not get along in the beginning of filming. Gosling at one point asked director Cassavetes to get rid of McAdams and to bring another actress to read the script with him. After a few therapy sessions it seemed that Gosling and McAdams got everything settled and moved on to film the movie.

      <p> “The Notebook”, is a one of a kind romance film that will steal your heart right away. This love story will not leave one dry eye in the room. It is a perfect date night movie or Valentine’s Day film. Adams and Gosling without a doubt gave everything they had into this film bringing “The Notebook” to life! Winning plenty of awards to go with it nine Teen Choice Awards, MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss, Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress, and BMI Film Music Award. Many people thought that this film would not amount to what it is today. “The Notebook” had two actors that were not well known which brought even more doubts. The director and producers overcame the circumstances and continued with their vision. According to Time magazine the film had a budget of 29 million dollars and made a domestic total of 119 million. The first weekend it came out it made 13.9 million which is about half of their budget. This timeless film was a huge success when it came out it is considered one for the books. This will forever be one of my favorite movies.
